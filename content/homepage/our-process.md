At Cory's Field Services, we follow a simple process:

1. Contact us to schedule an appointment for underground imaging services.
2. We arrive at the site with the necessary equipment and conduct the scan in multiple directions.
3. We will provide you with a view of the area and data values for analysis.
4. Finally, we will stake out the best suggested points for a driller, and will provide data for the customer.

Here are some examples of our past work:

### Residential Well in Southfork, Colorado.

This scan is of an residential well staked and drilled in Southfork, Colorado, to **825 feet** and produced **25 GPM**. In this scan, you can see the different layers from the red representing positive minerals in the soil (irons) to the yellows representing the gravel and sands that can be either positive, showing dry, or negative, showing water saturation. The green represents the clay and silts present, which can also be negative or positive.
